# Proposal

The project is based on implementing a simple map with the location of the user and the control of permissions, in addition to adding navigation to the activation-deactivation section of the app's permissions. 

# Architecture

The architecture that I have tried to implement is MVVM + SwiftUI. The VM handle States in this example.

# Start 

You only need to download the project and run there is no dependence on third parties.
